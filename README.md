**This is alpha version! It is not suitable for any use in production and is intended to demonstrate capabilities of Hyperledger Sawtooth in the scope of REMME.**

The first release of REMME Core 0.1.0 alpha laid the foundation for the REMME protocol:

* the architecture and high-level logic of working with SSL / TLS certificates have been developed: issuing and revoked certificates on the REMME blockchain (REMchain) level;
* the basic elements of the economy of the REM token have been integrated in the form of a mechanism for the token emission and the possibility of their transfer between users at the REMchain level;
* a command-line interface (CLI) for convenient access to the core functionality (issuing and revoking certificates, transferring REM tokens between users) has been incorporated.

## How to run

You will need Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

When you have this repository cloned run the following commands:

* `make build_docker`
* `make run`

After all the package are started up run `make shell` to enter the console.

You can try `rem-token` and `rem-crt` commands to run operations related to token and certificates respectively.

## To be done in the next releases

* Automated testing (needed to initialize MockValidator with the genesis batch). It is possible, that MockValidator will be replaced with real validator until genesis batches are implemented in MockValidator.
* Massive refactoring related to payments for the process of registration of new certificates.
* First deploy of test network based on PoET consensus.
* Research on implementation of a custom consensus in Sawtooth.
* Architecture of the process of token migration between REMME (test network) and Ethereum networks (Kovan testnet).
