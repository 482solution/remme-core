**This is an alpha version! It is not suitable for any use in production and is intended to demonstrate capabilities of Hyperledger Sawtooth in the scope of REMME.**

## How to run

You will need Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### For an end-user

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core/releases) section (`<version_number>-release.zip`). Unpack it.
1. Start node: Open a terminal inside the unpacked folder and run `./run.sh`.
1. Enter interactive shell: Open a new terminal window and run `./shell.sh`.

On the first run you will need to initialize the genesis block. To make that just run `./genesis.sh`. This will generate a new key pair and genesis block.
