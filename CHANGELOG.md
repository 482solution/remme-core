### Added
- The architecture and high-level logic of working with SSL / TLS certificates have been developed: issuing and revoked certificates on the REMME blockchain (REMchain) level;
- The basic elements of the economy of the REM token have been integrated in the form of a mechanism for the token emission and the possibility of their transfer between users at the REMchain level;
- A command-line interface (CLI) for convenient access to the core functionality (issuing and revoking certificates, transferring REM tokens between users) has been incorporated.
